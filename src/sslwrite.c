 *  NAME
 *      sslWrite - write data to a SSL/TLS connection
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *      int sslWrite(
 *          SSL        *ssl,        // OpenSSL SSL structure
 *          const void *buf,        // buffer of data to write
 *          int        num);        // number of data to write
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *      sslWrite() writes num bytes from the buffer buf into the specified ssl connection. This is a smart method to call the OpenSSL library SSL_write()
 *      bypassing the architectural features of OpenSSL that includes read/write actions in every read/write/accept/connect/shutdown action. This function
 *      analize the SSL_write() result to repeat the action (after a timeout of SSL_RWTOUT ms) until the activity is terminated. if the number of repeated
 *      iterations is too high (>SSL_RWITER), the activity is terminated with an error (total timeout is SSL_RWTOUT * SSL_RWITER seconds).
 *  RETURN VALUE
 *      Upon successful completion, sslWrite() shall return the number of characters sent.
 *      Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and the error can be analyzed calling the OpenSSL library SSL_get_error() function with the return value to find out the
 *      reason.
