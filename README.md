# MySSL 

A user-friendly interface to the OpenSSL library
================================================

Overview
--------

The MySSL library is a simple interface to OpenSSL library to permits 
user-friendly writing (in C or C++) of SSL Servers and SSL Clients.

- The free software library "OpenSSL" is distributed under a "dual licensed" 
  system: under the OpenSSL License and the SSLeay License. The OpenSSL License

- The library "OpenSSL" reference version is 1.0.2g

- Currently the MySSL library only supports Linux systems.


Installation
------------

This is currently a beta version, and uses a very simple Makefile: so to generate 
and test the MySSL library you need to do some manual steps:

1. Go to the src directory and generate the library with "make clean && make". 
   This generates a shared-library (libmyssl.so) and copies it to the tests/lib 
   directory. The header file myssl.h is also copied to the tests/include 
   directory.
2. Position yourself in the tests directory and generate the two test programs 
   (sslserver and sslclient) with "make clean && make".
3. See the "Testing" paragraph of this file to see how to execute a simple test 
   of the MySSL library using two terminals.
4. Note that in this beta version the library is not installed automatically, so 
   to perform the test you can install the libmyssl.so in the system or you can 
   do a temporary installation in both two terminals in this way:

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="~/path-of-myssl-package/tests/lib"

The next version of the MySSL library will use Autotools to build and install
automatically and to make the package portable to many Unix-like systems.


Testing
-------

Two tests are provided in *tests/server* and *tests/client* directories, you 
can freely edit the source code to fit your needs (it's Free Software :).

The two test programs are a SSL Server and a SSL Client that use the MySSL 
library and, in addition to testing the library, they can serve as an example
of how to write code using the MySSL library. 

The two test directories provide basic (and working) examples of the SSL 
certificates used by the MySSL library to work.

For a quick test of MySSL library, you can run the following programs in two 
shells open in the directories tests/server and tests/client:

1. ./sslserver 8888
2. ./sslclient 127.0.0.1 8888
